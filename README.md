Medical Cost Insurance Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts medical insurance costs based on personal and demographic information such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

🎯 Objective

Build and compare multiple regression machine learning models to predict an individual's medical insurance charges.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the popular Medical Cost Personal Dataset.

Typical features:

age
sex
bmi
children
smoker
region

Target:

charges — medical insurance cost

🤖 Models

The project will compare regression algorithms such as:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
ElasticNet
Random Forest Regressor
Extra Trees Regressor
AdaBoost Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
CatBoost Regressor
SGD Regressor
📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models will be evaluated using:

MAE — Mean Absolute Error
MSE — Mean Squared Error
RMSE — Root Mean Squared Error
R² Score

The model with the best performance will be selected for deployment.

🌐 Streamlit Application

The final model will be integrated into a Streamlit web application where users can enter details such as:

Age
Gender
BMI
Number of Children
Smoker
Region

and receive a predicted medical insurance cost.
